Artificial Intelligence, Fall 2022

This course will introduce the basic ideas and techniques underlying the design of intelligent
computer systems. A specifc emphasis will be on the statistical and decision-theoretic modeling
paradigm.

By the end of the course, I have built autonomous agents that efficiently make decisions in 
fully informed, partially observable, and adversarial settings. My agents are able to draw 
inferences in uncertain environments and optimize actions for arbitrary reward structures.
My machine learning algorithms are able to classify handwritten digits and photographs. The 
techinques that I have learned in this course will apply to a wide varierty of artificial
intelligence problems and will serve as a the foundation for further study in any application 
area I wish to puruse.
